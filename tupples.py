# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.

# Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

# But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple
